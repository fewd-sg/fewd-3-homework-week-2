### Homework Comments
Since you are making use of Bootstrap, you want to be careful with the order of how you link CSS files.

Be sure to link your bootstrap.css file before linking your style.css! This is so that your styles will overwrite the Bootstrap styles. 

Also, very interesting link you have there ;)
